	<p>Audio Player Usage: </p>
	<p>"This audio player was developed for the purpose of playing audio recordings which display the text of the narration as the audio proceeds. The main impetus for developing the player was to facilitate the study of Biblical Greek and Hebrew, with the Greek or Hebrew verses being displayed on the screen as the narrator reads that verse. However, the player can be used for any context where one wishes to play an audio file while displaying text, or images, at set intervals in the audio file."
	</p>
	<p>"Following is a brief description of how to use the audio player:"</p>
	
	<p><h2>Reader / Book:</h2>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="column" id='col1'>
	    <img id='ctrlImage' src='./images/reader-book.jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='156px' height='56px'>
	  </div>
	  <div class="column" id='col2'>
	    <img id='ctrlImage' src='./images/book.jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='156px' height='56px'>
	  </div>	  
	</div>
	The first drop down menu on the sidebar of the player Is where the user selects the 'Reader' (i.e. narrator) and the 'Book' that one wishes to hear. If there is only one reader in this installation of the player, the heading may simply be 'Book' as in the second image above. If there are multiple readers, the heading will be something like "Reader / Book' as in the first image above. For Biblical languages, this is where the user selects the book of the Bible he/she wishes to hear. If there are multiple readers then the user selects both reader and book here (eg. 'BPK / Luke').</p>
	
	<h2>Chapter:</h2>	
	<p><img id='chImg' src='./images/chapter.jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='156px' height='56px'> The next drop down menu on the sidebar is where the user selects the 'Chapter'. For Biblical languages, this would be the a chapter in the book selected above. Thus, if one selected "Acts" in the first menu, then here one would select from the chapters of Acts available from this reader - or at least those loaded onto the player. When the chapter is selected, then (1) the dropdown menus for 'Start' (verse) and 'End' (verse) are filled in and (2) the audio file itself is loaded. At this point the user can simply play the audio from the beginning, or else he/she could move the audio to a specific verse by selecting a 'Start' verse.</p>
	
	<h2>Play Mode:</h2>
	<p><img id='plModeImg' src='./images/playmode.jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='156px' height='56px'> The third drop down menu is entitled "Play Mode". Here the user selects how the audio player is to play. The default mode is "all". In this mode, the video player simply plays in the normal fashion, from the beginning of the audio file. If the user hits the "Repeat" button (described below), then the audio goes back to the beginning. Otherwise, unless the user presses a control, the audio will proceed through to the end. </p>
	
	<p>In the "verse by verse" mode, the audio will stop at the end of each verse. If the user clicks the "Repeat" button, the audio file will go back one verse.</p>
	
	<p>The last mode is "range of verses". In this mode the user selects a "Start" verse and and "End" verse, and then sets the "Play Mode" to "range of verses". It is <b>important</b> to note here that: the "Start" and "End" verses must be set <b>BEFORE</b> selecting the "range of verses" mode. Otherwise, the "Play Mode" will automatically revert back to "all". When one is playing the audio in "range of verses" mode, the audio will start at the "Start" verse and stop at the "End" verse. If one clicks the "Repeat" button in this mode, the audio will go back to the first verse of the range.</p>
	
	<h2>Start and End Verses:</h2>
	<p><img id='stEnd' src='./images/start-end.jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='156px' height='56px'> The "Start" verse and "End" verse menus are desribed in the section above. For Biblical language users, it should be noted here that a verse of "0" indicates an introduction to the chapter which many readers give before beginning their narration of the Biblical text. Typically, this would be - in Greek or Hebrew - the book and chapter to be read. Sometimes the narrator will give his/her name also.</p>
	
	<h2>Text Display Checkbox and Font Adjustment:</h2>

	<p><img id='text_font_img' src='./images/display_text-font.jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='156px' height='56px'> As seen in the image above, the next controls on the sidebar allow the user to control whether or not he/she wishes to see the text displayed on the screen as the audio plays. If the user does not wish the verse text to be displayed he/she unchecks the box. Here also (on the right) the user can change the font for the display window, and can increase or decrease the font size. <b>Please note: the selected font will only be implemented if that font is installed on the user's machine/device or if that font is set up as a "web font".</b> If neither of these requirements is met, then the font will not change, or else will change to a secondary font.</p>
	
	<h2>Screen Colours:</h2>
	<p><img id='scrCols' src='./images/screen_colours.jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='156px' height='56px'> At the bottom of the sidebar is a button which allows the user to set the background colour and the text colour of the display. It is easiest to enter the desired colour by selecting the colour from a "color picker' and copying the colour in "hex" mode as, for example, "#8080ff". However, the input will also accept common colour names such as "white", "red", "green", etc. Selecting a colour from the "colour picker" that one can preview ahead of time allows for a much more refined choice. There are lots of "colour pickers" available on the internet. One quite good "color picker" is found at: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp</a></p>
	
	<h2>Audio Controls:</h2>
	<p><img id='audCtrls' src='./images/audio_controls(numbered).jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='503px' height='56px'> The final set of controls to be considered are the audio controls themselves. To simplify the description, the controls have been numbered for easy reference.</p>
	
	<p>Starting at the center (3) is the play/pause button. The user clicks this button to start or pause the audio. When the audio is playing, the image will change from the arrow (as in the image above) to the pause symbol as seen in the this image.
	[ <img id='pauseImg' src='./images/pauseBtn.png' type='image/png' width='24px' height='24px'> ]</p>
		
	<p>To the left and the right of the play/pause button (buttons 2 and 4) are the buttons which will move the audio ahead one verse [ <img id='nxtVs' src='./images/nextVerse.png' type='image/png' width='24px' height='24px'> ] (4), or back one verse [ <img id='prevVs' src='./images/previousVerse.png' type='image/png' width='24px' height='24px'> ] (2). If one is in "range of verses" mode, these two buttons will not move outside of the selected range.</p>
	
	<p>Button 1 [ <img id='nxtVs' src='./images/repeatBtn.png' type='image/png' width='24px' height='24px'> ] is the "Repeat" button described above. It will move the audio to the beginning in the "all" mode or "verse by verse" mode; and to the beginning of the range for "range of verses" mode</p>
	
	<p>Button 5 [ <img id='nxtVs' src='./images/lastVerseBtn.png' type='image/png' width='24px' height='24px'> ] is the "Last Verse" button. It will move the audio to the last verse in the "all" mode or the "verse by verse" mode; and to the end of the selected range for the "range of verses" mode</p>

	<p>Element number six on the controls image above, show the current time of the video and the total duration of the video. Thus, '1:12 / 3:54' indicates that the audio recording is at the 1 minute and 12 second point of an audio file which has a total duration of 3 minutes and 54 seconds.</p>
	
	<p>Element 7 is the mute [ <img id='nxtVs' src='./images/muteBtn.png' type='image/png' width='24px' height='24px'> ] / unmute [  <img id='nxtVs' src='./images/unMuteBtn.png' type='image/png' width='24px' height='24px'>  ] button. On some browsers the mute button may slide the volume control (8) all the ways to the left, so if the sound is still off when the 'unmute' button is clicked, the user should ensure that the volume slider is not all the way to the left.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, the number 8 volume control [ <img id='nxtVs' src='./images/volSlider.jpg' type='image/jpeg' width='24px' height='24px'> ] adjusts the sound volume up or down. On a computer with a mouse, the volume slider is hidden unless the user places the mouse over any part of the audio controls. On a 'touch screen' device, the audio will appear if the user touches any part of the audio controls.</p>
